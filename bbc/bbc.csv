"His comments, made to donors at a fundraising event on Tuesday, marked his strongest criticism yet of Israel's leadership. ,Mr Biden has offered unwavering public support to the country since Hamas launched its attacks on 7 October.,And while he reiterated that Israel could count on US backing, he issued a direct warning to its government.,""Israel's security can rest on the United States, but right now it has more than the United States. It has the European Union, it has Europe, it has most of the world,"" he told donors to his 2024 re-election campaign in Washington.,""But they're starting to lose that support by indiscriminate bombing that takes place,"" he said.,Mr Biden, however, added that there was ""no question about the need to take on Hamas"" and Israel had ""every right"" to do so.,The US leader has faced growing pressure, including from within his own Democratic Party, to rein in Israel's military campaign. His remarks align with his administration's recent approach to the war, with officials urging Israel to ""put a premium on human life"" and give clearer instructions to allow people to avoid the conflict.,Senior US officials have also displayed increasing discontent at Israel's military response.,The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza has said more than 18,400 people have been killed by Israeli bombing since 7 October, when Hamas broke through Israel's heavily guarded perimeter and killed 1,200 people.,In a statement later on Tuesday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel had received the ""full backing"" of the US for its ground war as well as its goal of destroying Hamas and recovering hostages.,He added that Washington had blocked ""international pressure to stop the war"".,""Yes, there is disagreement about 'the day after Hamas' and I hope that we will reach [an] agreement here as well,"" he said.,Mr Biden alluded to the pair's disagreement in his comments on Tuesday and said Mr Netanyahu had to ""change"" his government as well as his stance on a two-state solution, which top US officials have been promoting as the post-war path.,That proposal is favoured by the international community to end the decades-long conflict, and would lead to the creation of an independent Palestinian state in Gaza and the West Bank existing alongside Israel.,""This is the most conservative government in Israel's history,"" Mr Biden said. ""This government in Israel is making it very difficult for him. They don't want a two-state solution."",His comments reflect the emerging disagreements about what direction to take after the war. Mr Netanyahu has said he opposes US calls to have the Palestinian Authority, which currently administers parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, take over control of Gaza.,While Mr Biden's words were his bluntest yet, senior American officials have increasingly expressed discontent with Israel's military campaign.,Secretary of State Antony Blinken said just days ago that there was a ""gap"" between pledges by Israeli authorities to spare civilians in Gaza and the reality on the ground.,This video can not be played,Watch: How Biden's message to Israel has evolved,© 2023 BBC.

"Users around the world watched The Night Agent for 812m hours, making the political thriller its most viewed show in the first half of this year.,The streaming giant has been criticised for not being transparent about how content performs on its platform.,The criticism was central to this year's Hollywood strikes, which paralysed the film and television industry for several months.,Actors and writers have been demanding higher royalties for shows that performed well on streaming platforms.,On a conference call with the media, co-chief executive Ted Sarandos acknowledged that the lack of transparency about the popularity of its shows had led to distrust in the creator community.,He added that Netflix had kept its viewer data private while it was building the business so it could experiment without giving away crucial information to potential competitors.,""This is a big step forward for Netflix and our industry,"" the company said in a blog post.,""We believe the viewing information in this report... will give creators and our industry deeper insights into our audiences, and what resonates with them."",Hollywood's creative community relies on viewing figures from audience data firm Nielsen - released annually - for traditional broadcast and cable television.,The , ranks 18,000 titles by the amount of hours viewed between January and June this year. The company said it will now release the report every six months. ,Covering nearly 100 billion hours of viewing time, other shows that featured prominently on the list included Ginny and Georgia, Gilmore Girls, Seinfeld, Friends and The Office.,The Mother starring Jennifer Lopez was the top movie, watched for more than 249 million hours.,Non-English content generated about a third of all viewing and Netflix said the data also shows there is still demand for older titles.,""Success on Netflix comes in all shapes and sizes, and is not determined by hours viewed alone. We have enormously successful movies and TV shows with both lower and higher hours viewed. It's all about whether a movie or TV show thrilled its audience — and the size of that audience relative to the economics of the title,"" the company said.,With almost 250 million subscribers globally, Netflix is the largest streaming service in the world.,Since 2021, it has been releasing weekly Top 10 and Most Popular lists, which show the most-watched movies and TV shows in English and other languages.,Netflix said that more than half of the titles released this year appeared on the weekly Top 10 lists.,The What We Watched report showed 55% of Netflix viewing came from original films and series and 45% from licensed titles, according to Mr Sarandos.,Last year, Netflix launched a separate service with adverts, which requires more transparency because advertisers want information about the popularity of content.,© 2023 BBC.

"Visible around the world, they can be seen with the naked eye, though check the weather where you are as it will affect visibility.,In perfect conditions, viewers may spot 100 to 120 meteors per hour.,Nasa calls the Geminids one of the year's ""best and most reliable annual meteor showers"".,Meteor showers are typically caused by a comet, but the Geminids are celestial debris left behind by a rocky asteroid known as 3200 Phaethon.,Meteors occur when the Earth passes through trails of debris from comets or asteroids. As that debris hits our planet's atmosphere, it burns up and creates spectacular streaks of light.,The name Geminids comes from Gemini, the constellation from which these meteors appear to emerge.,The Royal Observatory, Greenwich, says the Geminids are distinctive because of their colours - they can be white, yellow, green, red and blue. It puts this down to the presence of metals like sodium and calcium, adding that this the same effect that is used to make fireworks colourful.,""This meteor shower is just a beautiful night sky event where many shooting stars seem to come from the same area in the sky,"" said Dr Minjae Kim, an astronomy and astrophysics research fellow at the University of Warwick.,You can see meteors anywhere in the sky, so it's a good idea to be in a dark open space where you can see the night sky for the best chance of spotting this spectacular show.,While the display of 'shooting stars' is already underway, in the UK the peak of the meteor shower is expected to start around 19:30 GMT on Thursday, 14 December.,Dr Kim suggested downloading a stargazing app to help you know where to look. ,""If you can find the Gemini constellation first, it's a piece of cake to see the meteor shower,"" he says.,Other tips from Dr Kim include giving your eyes time to adjust to to the dark, and taking a friend along - that way you can keep your eyes on different parts of the sky.,Don't worry if you don't manage to see the Geminids during their peak.

"Her aim has been to cut the use of plastic polymers, known as polyurethane, in furniture making. That meant finding a more environmentally-friendly material to fill pillows, sofas and chair cushions.,To start with, the founder of Oslo-based Agoprene and her colleagues experimented with using oyster shells. The shells were ground into a powder and used to make a foamy material. Agricultural waste and wood fibres were experimented with in a similar way.,""We tried a bunch of different materials, but most of them turned out as rigid foam, not flexible,"" she says.,But eventually Ms Sandberg hit on seaweed, which her team transformed into a powder and baked in a special oven.,The process creates a foam block, soft enough to be used in seat cushions and chairs.,""The foam is 100% biodegradable. You can simply leave it in the soil, and it will naturally degrade over eight months - faster if you cut it into smaller pieces,"" says Ms Sandberg. ,Agoprene is now looking to scale-up production by moving to a larger manufacturing facility in the coming year.,Can such innovation move furniture away from plastic, which is used in numerous ways in the furniture industry?,As well as polyurethane, which provides cushioning, the outside of soft furnishings might contain polyester - also part of the plastic family.,Faux leather furniture might use a vinyl blend, and vinyl is a convenient shorthand for a whole class of plastics. Meanwhile, cheaper wood furniture is often just a wood veneer stuck to plastic. ,Industrially-produced wood furniture is often coated in a blend of chemicals, which may include polymers. That's what gives the wood that glossy, plastic-like appearance. ,There are good reasons why plastic is so common, explains Christian Euler, an assistant professor in chemical engineering at the University of Waterloo in Ontario.,""It performs very well for its intended functions, and has a high degree of flexibility which allows it be soft or hard,"" he says.,""Also, because plastic's chemicals come from by-products from oil refining, it's cheap to make."",But there are serious downsides to cheap, plastic-laden furniture. For a start, more and more of it is being thrown away.,The Environmental Protection Agency in the US estimates that 12 million tonnes of furniture was discarded in 2018, up from eight million tonnes in 2000.,Around 80% of that furniture discarded in 2018 in the US ended up in landfill, where the plastic parts , to break down.,Meanwhile, making the plastic that goes into furniture involves carbon emissions. According to Agropene's calculations, polyurethane foam rubber accounts for a 105 million tonnes of CO2 emissions every year.,So numerous firms are looking for alternative materials. ,Danish design company Mater has produced a line of chairs that feature seats and backrests made from materials blended with either discarded coffee bean shells or sawdust from furniture production.,Its outdoor furniture is composed of ocean waste. ,""We like mixing creativity with innovation,"" says chief executive Ketil Ardal.,""While it takes a lot of cash to manufacture these sustainable collections, and I get some grey hairs because of it, it's in our DNA to be a green company."",Beyond seaweed and coffee shell waste, another unusual option researchers are hoping may replace plastic is fungus.,Mycellium, the root-like and branching structure of a fungus, is the foundation behind BioKnit, a new type of textile developed by researchers at Newcastle Upon Tyne's Hub for Biotechnology in the Built Environment (HBBE).,The process starts with mycelium grown on a substrate such as sawdust, says Jane Scott, lead of the HBBE's Living Textiles Group, and then it's placed in a dark and humid environment so it binds and absorbs nutrients from the sawdust. Then it dehydrates in an oven-like device.,She notes BioKnit is already being used by designers to make lampshades, for example.,Ms Scott says an advantage of this material is how it ""decomposes since it's bio-based and doesn't use any binders or glue that wouldn't decompose in a landfill."",Major design brands are seeking to join smaller nimbler companies in ushering in sustainable materials into their furniture pieces. US kitchenware and home furnishings firm Williams Sonoma has said it's now using responsibly sourced cotton and recycled polyester, and IKEA plans to use only renewable and recycled materials in its products by 2030.,Ms Sandberg says she's encouraged to see the furniture industry open to changing its wasteful ways. ""I thought this industry didn't want to try anything new and only stay with polyurethane, but they are open and curious and willing to test and try new products because they want to see change happen with the products they create."",© 2023 BBC.

"It is part of the ""economic shock therapy"" that President Javier Milei says the country needs to fix its worst crisis in decades.,Economy Minister Luis Caputo also announced deep cuts to public spending.,They include a reduction in fuel and transport subsidies and freezing spending on some major government contracts and advertising.,Mr Caputo said he had inherited the worst economic legacy in Argentina's history and he was taking steps to avoid hyperinflation. ,""We are going to be worse off than before for a few months, particularly in terms of inflation. And I say that because, as the president says, it is better to tell an uncomfortable truth than a comfortable lie,"" Mr Caputo said in a televised address.,Argentina is battling soaring inflation, with prices rising by around 150% over the last year. It is also struggling with low cash reserves, high government debt, while 40% of the population is living below the poverty line.,The International Monetary Fund (IMF) - to which Argentina owes $44bn (£35bn) - called the measures ""bold"" and said they will help create the environment for private sector growth.,""I welcome the decisive measures,"" IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva said, adding that it is ""an important step toward restoring stability and rebuilding the country's economic potential."",Mr Caputo said the exchange rate would be cut to 800 pesos to the US dollar, from roughly 391 pesos.,Since 2019, Argentina has kept its currency artificially strong by strictly controlling the movement of the currency.,That helped drive demand for the US dollar on the informal currency market, which saw the peso trading at a much lower rate that the the official level.,Mr Milei, a libertarian who rose from relative obscurity to the top office in a bitterly fought election, was sworn in on Sunday.,He campaigned on promises of major spending cuts and was known for wielding a chainsaw at rallies to depict his intentions to slash government spending.,It is not clear if his coalition, which is only the third largest bloc in the country's Congress will be able to implement enough major spending cuts needed to shore up the economy without pushing it into turmoil.,Mr Milei has already cut nine government ministries, which Mr Caputo said would reduce 34% of public sector jobs. ,Speaking about the cuts to government spending for infrastructure projects, Mr Caputo said: ""The reality is that there is no money to pay for more public works that, as all Argentines know, often end up in the pockets of politicians or businessmen on duty"".,© 2023 BBC.
